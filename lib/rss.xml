<br>A kobold swings at Dao and dips
<br>the trapmaster hits Dao with a javelin
<br>Gub runs forward and smacks him in the head, avoiding a <a href=".?query=tag:trap" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#trap</a>!
<br>Dao walks forward and tries to demoralize.
<br>Another kobold comes around and sets Gub up for flanking /w <a data-href="Trapmaster" href="\Trapmaster" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Trapmaster</a>
<br>Pandora Cubes walks forwards and Demoralizes Trapmaster
<br>Nishars walks forward and casts Four Winds! We all get a free move, gub moves around!
<br>Another kobold runs up and flanks Gub again! He swipes and does some damage!
<br>Trapmaster goes off, hits for damage and wiffs twice
<br>Nishara pulled the lever, and vaporizes a kobold! She runs ahead and vaprorizes a kobold with elemental blast
<br>Trapmaster whiffs against Gub and tries to run away! He doesn't get far.
<br>Gub closes distance and…. Also whiffs.
<br>Dao reloads and Thinks, gets the killing blow!
<br>Trapmaster mentions about a Green God (powerful character)<br>
We rest and heal, Dao Quick Tincture<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240201171050.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171050.png"><br>We head Downstairs 40ft or so, it's slimy! Enter into a room with rough defenses<br>
Gub notices nothing, and a Kobold pops up!<br>
Kobold was Hidden: makes an attack and attackee counts as Off-Guard. Gub gets machine gunned!<br>
<br>Pandora needledarts the kobold good!
<br>Nishara FourWinds ppl out into the room, peeps a Kobold, but it's still Hidden from us
<br>Dao maneuvers into position and THINKS!
<br>Gub Hides, Doesn't see Kobold, Seeks the Statue has Mechanical Joints
<br>Kobold goes, ignores Gub for Nishara, does some damage
<br>Nishara strides over and misses with an electric strike.
<br>Dao does some damage
<br>Gub runs up and smashes!
<br>North wall has some kind of hidden barricade, Dao tries to Craft it away and it crumbles, opening a new splitting passage ahead, it's stinky.<br>We walk ahead and encounter some slimes? Speaking Aklo, subterranean language!<br>NOT SLIMES, Dao talks to them! We are indeed not fishlike! Pandora plays CHUD Shanty and <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a>! They respected Pandora's bass drop and converse. Dao is able to talk, one was lost to the south, a green ball,&nbsp; another to the Mermaid room, which is beautiful and deadly. The Green God is a creature that the Kobold Leader, has wings and acidddddd<br>They leave! There's a thin wall at the top, we could push through it.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240201171123.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171123.png" style="width: 100px; max-width: 100%;"> Dao can hear Kobolds through there.<br>Orbs in the room! Brown earth and stone, Glass and clouds, Roaring Flame. They're clearly elemental conduits. Dao and Nishara advance into the room, and a big Fire Rat pops out of the red orb]]></description><link>session-notes\session-2-(2023-09-14).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/Session 2 (2023-09-14).md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 14:40:59 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171050.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171050.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 3 (2023-09-21)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:trap" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#trap</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:combat" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#combat</a>

 <br><br>We killed the dragon at the end of the Beginner's Box and began to Walk Gate!<br>
<br><br><br><br>9/28/2023 8:38 PM<br>
Cubes recaps, we do recall knowledges on Dragons. Gub remembers nothing. Nishara and Pandora also dunno!<br>
Dao knows all! The dragon is green for sure and enraged by red capes, definitely.<br>
Pandora full sends across the map and attracts a green dragon, The Preacher! a horse sized dragon, smelling of bleach<br><br>
<br>Dragon breathes so much chlorine gasssssss and drops Pandora. Gub runs and battle medicines Pandora back up, the dragon wiffs against Gub, and flies away!
<br>Dao finds no weaknesses, and moves. Nishara tickles the dragon with some elements. 
<br>Dragon breathes chlorine and barely hits Pandora. 
<br>Gub smashes good and tries to Grab but trips instead.
<br>Dao kills it!
<br><br>You should be able to answer the following questions tomorrow night:<br>Who is your character?<br>
Gub, orc warrior<br>What did you see in the <a data-href="Aiudara" href="\aiudara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aiudara</a> that made you walk into the shining portal that fateful night?<br>
eye-you-DARA<br>
The fight of his life! But then, the journey towards it!<br>Why did you answer Dr. Ritalson's call for <a data-href="Gatewalkers" href="\Gatewalkers" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gatewalkers</a>, and how did you find yourself fast-friends with the rest of the party?<br>
Dr. Ritalson's purple headveins<br>
<br>
The carriage enters a place, calm guards, stream, caravan, Ritalson's (ustelavian alchemist) put out a call, a search for answers

<br>
Thousands entered the gates, 30 returned, with a mark!

<br>
<a data-href="Sevenarches" href="\locations\sevenarches.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sevenarches</a> run by druids, oversee the area, an affliction hits the elfs that approach the gates. BUT since the missing moment, the curse has vanished aver 700 years???

<br>
Dubious Knowledge by Dao, heard rumors of fey creatures, normally oak stewards

<br>
<a data-href="Dr. Ritalson" href="\npcs\dr.-ritalson.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dr. Ritalson</a> leads the horses forward. He's pretty old. He yawns and lets us go, we're the best field researchers!

<br>
What happened to the thousands who didn't return? We've looked everywhere, in every library and tome. Quest is deeply personal, he gives his most promising lead. <a data-href="Sevenarches" href="\locations\sevenarches.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sevenarches</a>! The turn-to-ash curse was lifed the Missing Moment. Study the aiudara in person, and meet <a data-href="Fianara" href="\fianara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fianara</a> Caralestri, she's over there and covered in scrolls.

<br>
No other place in the world has this many aiudara, elf teleportation gates

<br>
Where'd they go? Elven dark realms where they come from.

<br>
<a data-href="Obnubilate Curse" href="\obnubilate-curse.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Obnubilate Curse</a>. Elves fall unconscious, shrivel, forget themselves, scream, turn to ash.

<br>9/28/2023 10:14 PM<br>
<br>Dr's Power: his big veins turn into eyeballs so he can read lots
<br>Can we talk to the elves? NO. They turn the forest against you and then kill you.
<br>Dr: meet me back in Lepinshctat. Not many secure communications.
<br>Meet <a data-href="Fianara" href="\fianara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Fianara</a>, she'll help /w extra help, she's an elf! Needs help getting into SevenArches past the oakstewards and shadow creatures. Actually named for Tourist Decoys! Paper Mache!
<br>She pulls out a bong /w wires, an <a data-href="aura recorder" href="\aura recorder" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">aura recorder</a> it'll record a agate's magic signature. Go to the tourist trpa and stick your hand through.
<br>There's alarmed guards and a velvet rope, but those gates didn't open! They're fake!
<br>9/28/2023 10:27 PM<br>
<br>Fiarana hands the bong to Nishara, and a disguise kit. Don't litter around the <a data-href="Oakstewards" href="\oakstewards.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Oakstewards</a>! They'll mostly try to cast you off
<br>We're three miles outside the city. Nishara keeps the hat of disguise.
<br>9/28/2023 10:37 PM<br>
<br>The fashion police head into the city!
<br>The wendmore and fogmore creek meet. Buildings on the outskirts are newer, outside of a nest of vinewalls that tie themselves around like mortar
<br>Reach the gate entrance. The Oakstewards are here, vine armor and weapons, magic flowers
<br>Two Stewards, gate guards. Pandora rolls perform to distract, Nishara sneaks right past.
<br>Gub unsuccessfully sells the "Statue" to an old man, as she blasts beats
<br>Repurposed archetecture, some human additions vines cover everything, everything is built around the park
<br>We check out arches, 20feet tall 10feet wall, energies impressive, vines and trees surrounding.
<br>A podium and businesses aruond, a large croud. An Oak Steward at the entrance. Many Arch-related businesses. NOON IN GAME.
<br>We fuss around the arches, visit Golden Arches
<br>Dao remembers their Ghost Hand power and hovers the bong in the arch while Pandora performs a distraction!

Find a gnome to tell us about the city, he says the arches are fake, turns ppl to squirrels<br>
Quaking Stacks = ancient elven books library, gnome friend got caught stealing, kicked out<br>
Thornleaf Barrack = underbrush, oaksteward armory<br>
Tannery = don't use animal leather! Wink wink<br>
Silver &amp; Cold = coinage and weapons<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240201171437.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171437.png"><br>Cabaret = fey themed. sometimes host fights<br>

Since we did this she'll offer info: the real seven arches aren't in Seven Arches. The real Arches are in the Wilewood. The stewards move them during the <img alt="Pasted image 20240201171331.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171331.png">. Seven Guards also disappeared, ONE CAME BACK, was jacked up, sickly. Btaken to vine counsel, got a fine for shirking duties during the Missing Moment. He killed one stole an artefact (very powerful) and rode out on a thorntide. Now he leads a rebellion in the security corridor.<br>We have an inn room! Her contact gave her a bark writ and a letter of introduction. Writ guarantees a mid-tier Steward lady who's agreeable. Artefact has something to do with our powers.<br>"Take this, go to the vinehall and meet <a data-href="Lemma Feldthorn" href="\lemma-feldthorn.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Lemma Feldthorn</a> (watch out for her horse)"<br>Dao, Pandora, Gub, find a caravan leader, Nishara finds another guy.<br>The Wood is about 50miles, two day ride, largest forest in 7A.

Stewards stretched thin. Pressure from the north now that the curse is gone. Rebellion to the south /w Bolan. He stole the key to the Gates. Stewards sent a spy who came back w/ bad news.<br>Get Bollen and the Key back to the Justice Hall.<br>
Can give access to a Caravan and a Writ through their controlled areas and to the Wood.&nbsp; The Real Seven Arches are at the Wilewood, a ritual is happening there later the week COUNTDOWN!<br>Return Bolan alive if possible, offers 30gp, half up front.

Striking Rune, +1 Damage Die, 65gp<br>GUB GETS BOTH!!!&nbsp; And now needs access to magical damage.<br>
We swing by the tannery; it's a front! The Caravan is well appointed, spartan, led by two horses, and head out. A Steward gives us maps and directions and shows us where the Real Seven Arches is.<br>Pass farms run by Leshy (plant creatures), Stewards help farmers. Gub uses Express Rider to gain 1.5 speed, we'll arrive during the day. The road gets worse and the forest gets spoopy.<br>As we sleep, we <a href=".?query=tag:dream" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#dream</a>! Dao saw something /w his brother, and sees a family scene /w their brother and walk through the blood red portal! A wide chasm, an empty pit but not empty, on a mountain sits a figure in a coat, a mask of flesh and fur and horns <a data-href="Horned One" href="\horned-one.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Horned One</a>, staring with sorrow and hatred. Something in the Pit Whispers.<br>We wake to Dao's sigil glowing, ghostly hands breaking trees and shit, bust up the caravan. About a minute later, Dao awakens a power! Ghost Hand Push, handprints everywhere!<br>Morning: Breakfast and heading out. Get close but have to ditch the cart for the overgrowth and bad road.<br>Spooky forest, even in the day.<br>A clearing! A Huge Stone Arch 50ft tall. Six other arches around.&nbsp; Some activity in the arches, doing….something. Shouting? The lights dim as we approach, but the whole party has dark or low light vision and we arrived during the day.&nbsp; Gub seems wisps of black smoke by a bush which explodes…..with activity!<br><br>
<br>Gub runs up, finds gross smoke dogs, and <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a>, pasting one! The superpowered Maul works!
<br>The dog <a data-href="Temygir" href="\Temygir" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Temygir</a> jumps through Gub's shadow over to Dao and bites Dao!
<br>Pandora Inspires and NeedleDarts.
<br>Dao doesn't get much info and swings and wiffs.
<br>Nishara opens her elementa gate channeling elements, killing the second! 15xp
<br>COMBAT ENDS<br>Nishara remembers what they are: Temegir, personified fear from the First World (of the fey), made of the Fear of Being Stalked in the Night.&nbsp; If they kill you they eat your shadow!<br>Small break for healing and sneak forward, finding a shadowy line around the arches, everything inside looks like charcoal drawings. A ShadowShift Field!&nbsp; It transports you to the Fae world, can be suppressed for an hour by bending the field to your will. Nishara does so and wills the ritual to fade for one hour. 15xp!<br>The ppl in the arches (200ft away) don't yet notice.<br>They're carving stuff into the ground, some kind of bundle in the middle /w torches around. Mb luggage?&nbsp; We try to sneak up but everyone sees Gub! They chant primal words, their weapons glow and grow! One throws a gust of wind, the sheet blows off revealing a Unicorn stabbed and getting ready to sacrifice!<br><br>
<br>Gub rolls poorly!
<br><a data-href="Unicorn" href="\Unicorn" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Unicorn</a> cries!
<br>Pandora Inspires and darts a guy.
<br>Nishara uses Four Winds, we get a free mini move! And electocutes a Bad Steward
<br>Dao Strides and Stabs, dropping a Bad Steward! Exploits Vulnerability on them.
<br>A Bad Warden runs forward and whiffs against Gub! Twice!
<br>The Second runs for Flanking, and hits Gub, right in the ass!
<br>Gub pastes that Bad Steward, the second gives up.
<br>The Unicorn explodes out and charges through Dao!
<br>Pandora heals the Unicorn to sooth its wounds, the knives falling out, then a tiny sunflower falls out, shrieking! The unicorn runs off and the sunflower seed dies. 60xp for freeing the Unicorn and killing the guy.
<br>Nature could soothe the beast, or healing.&nbsp; Healing killed the sunflower seed thing!
<br>What tales will this captured oak steward tell??? Will the Unicorn return with loot? Next time, on Gatewalkers!]]></description><link>session-notes\session-5-(2023-10-05).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/Session 5 (2023-10-05).md</guid><pubDate>Thu, 07 Mar 2024 14:42:22 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171437.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\pasted-image-20240201171437.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 6 (2023-10-12)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:crits" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#crits</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:crits" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#crits</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:crits" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#crits</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:trap" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#trap</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a>

A kitchen full of more meats off to the side. The ceilings of these rooms goes off to forever. She's eating, will deal /w us later when she's done. Dao fails to recall knowledge, Pandora performs and impresses her, she's hungry for Pandora flesh.<br>We line up and begin <br><br>when she finishes eating and fires off<br>
<br>Centaurwoman rolls high, runs up to Pandora and takes a bite.
<br>Nishara shoots water at the wirebladehook servitor, at the end of her turn it retaliates by detaching its blades and attacking, Nishara resists /w Will
<br>Orb retracts its orbs and chainsaws into Gub, Nishara, Gub, and Pandora. It then frightens Nishara.
<br>Pandora strides away, Inspires, and fails to Demoralize. Pandora stops bleeding!
<br>Dao Devises a Stratagem on the lil guy. It's a Velstrack, too cool for Hell. This is an Augur. Dao shoots and <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a>, it dies! It drops and squishes like a sponge.<br>

<br>Gub's turn, he moves, smashes her good, and trips the centaurlady.
<br>Centaurwoman gets up, hoofs Gub, and raises her shield
<br>Nishara shoots, misses, and misses again.
<br>The Orb regenerates, gets up, and chainsaws Dao, Nishara, and Gub (Gub spends a hero point 1 to 20, <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a> success)

<br>Kaneepo gets baned for all eternity
<br>Kaneepo finds the Seven Arches. Striding through, he meets cruel gross elves, he tries to make friends but they attack him
<br>Kaneepo eats all their shadows, the image reverses. He's mutilating elves, their blood flows into the tree. He's making the <a data-href="Obnubilate Curse" href="\obnubilate-curse.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Obnubilate Curse</a>!
<br>A group of Elven heroes beat him through the Seven Arches and the Night Hold to the Tree Stump we're in.
<br>Kaneepo sits for millenia in a cage, his blood pooling into the room
<br>Kaneepo breaks free of his prison, hunts down and slay the descendants, retrieve the key, and weaves a great curse from the corpses. The curse flows like a river of death.&nbsp; He outlived his captor's magic as he grew and matured.
<br>Kaneepo sits on a throne of elf skulls
<br>Exit to the north into an artist studio, a painting in the middle of the room is leaking blood. Nishara runs up and takes off the tarp!<br>A boney hand takes the tarp off. It's Kaneepo's throne, with all of us wearing his smile.<br>Gub notices a stash in the art supplies. Bioluminescence Bombs!<br>A door to the east explodes as a magic insect dude blasts in and initiates combat! He's glowing with scintillating lines.<br><br>
<br>Pandora Anthems, Needle Darts
<br>The creature's body quickens, it runs up and strikes twice! A fortunate crit /w a low damage roll. It screams and detonates in color! Fort saves. Gub crit successes, Dao and Nishara are dazzled! Everything is concealed for a round. Pandora got nailed by light.

<br>Gub Rages, moves, and misses :(
<br>Nishara balms herself and tries to attack the Bug.
<br>Pandora Anthems, moves and tries to demoralize the Bug, failing :(
<br>Bug moves and doublehits Nishara. Nishara flickers, gaining consealment, which ruins its next attack!
<br>Dao Thinks about it, it's a Dizurak, a termite from the plane of shadow, a lady, Dao shoots and hits! Glowing ichor oozes out like glowstick fluid.
<br>Gub stides, Smashes, and Smashes again.
<br>It was The Chronicler, a Librarian :(<br>Into the library to the east, we find some collector tomes among the many books.<br>Pandora opens the door to a surgical theatre covered in geometric grooves for collecting blood. A japanese knife ghost attacks Dao; I'll stop this choice! She's really hazy (concealed?)<br><br>

An artist studio reveals a haunting painting of us under Kaneepo's influence, and we kill a magic insect, The Chronicler, leading us to a library with collector tomes. A surgical theatre presents a Japanese knife ghost, which Dao tactically evades! Our investigation hints at paintings with sinister abilities.<br>

 <br><br>We explore a jungle, spotting pyramid structures and encountering exotic creatures, including a tree fisher and a snail-ipede. Crossing a rust-red river, we fight off amphibious threats.

Emerald green westward, two POIs:<br>Mountain range, miles away, pyramid structures on the slopes<br>Gleaming purple ropes connect the pyramids to the hill, large platforms suspended like gondolas carrying cargo from the hills, returning empty. Lots of other buildings, substantial settlement.&nbsp;<br>The air is rich and velvety, we head off towards the base of the village.

<br>Gub hits and <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a> it to death, and we leave and run away, looting the monkey (Tree Fisher) corpse with some filament and a gland.

<br>A catlike creature /w frog eggs attacks Gub, screaming and popping a fireball

<br>The second adult cat bites Nishrara and venomizes her!
<br>We kill the cats w/o too much trouble.
<br>Inspecting the elf statue: it's a full statue, like to the feet, a few hundred years old. We continue to the top of the hill<br>A quarry, sheer 15ft walls, precisely carved.

At night, we're taken to a dome with a huge telescope, meeting <a data-href="Gentheel" href="\npcs\gentheel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gentheel</a> and the council. Discussing the Missing Moment and the <a data-href="Shadewither Key" href="\Shadewither Key" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Shadewither Key</a>'s curse, we learn it's controlled by a psychic trigger related to Gentheel's mother. Tasked to find her in The Garden, a place for the city's greatest minds, we descend into a cavern and fight <a data-href="Immoles" href="\Immoles" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Immoles</a>. After defeating them, we discover a room filled with statues in robes.<br>
<br><br><br><br>Cubes recaps!<br>
Platform nears the beginnings of a pyramid city, many in construction. Lots of telescopes, including one huge one!<br>
About 75 various elves in furs and leather, not ostentatious, except for lots of jewelry, each engraved /w symbols, not elven writing or mystical runes.<br>
The elves talk excitedly to us! Gub and Pandora hype the crowd, Nishara and Dao actually talk to them:<br>
They want to know who we are, what we're doing, etc<br>
A woman cuts through the crowd towards us<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240206085927.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240206085927.png"><br>
Everyone has a telescope or binoculars; they're all looking for something, clearly.<br>
She shows us one bright star, a pale blue dot. We're on Castrovel, second planet from the sun the homeworld of the Elves.  She leads us through <a data-href="Loskialua" href="\locations\loskialua.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Loskialua</a> to an inn.<br>

We're in the middle of nowhere<br>
We came in through a Olde First-World portal<br>
She waves over an elf kid, Benly, our translator for business<br>
They don't get visitors often, everyone will be excited!<br>
Nishara buys a Gate Attenuator (Air)!<br>
We sell off CONSTRUCTION MATERIAL (the gland and the string)<br>
Benly tells a story about the Apes; they were benign but were psychically enhanced<br>
Benly only has six or seven rings, it's a tradition<br>
Mentions the city usually barters and that we're hung up on material stuff<br>
Lights come on at night, and huge plump fireflies gather around<br>
A-Lay-Lay leads us to the dome /w the hugest telescope.<br>
This city is built into the mountains, reverent of nature<br>
Chanting from the big room!<br>
A huge room filled /w astronomical symbols, a variety of people sit on pillows, facing a central figure:<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240206085941.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240206085941.png"><br>We hear "<a data-href="Dezna" href="\Dezna" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dezna</a>" from the people praying; she's a Golarian goddess, aid others, explore, don't cause fear or dispair, don't use magic to corrupt dreams, or being a bigot.<br>
They bring us pillows to sit, as Pandora makes a mighty impression.<br>
<a data-href="Gentheel" href="\npcs\gentheel.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Gentheel</a> the Rememberance, and the elected council of <a data-href="Loskialua" href="\locations\loskialua.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Loskialua</a>, we're welcomed!<br>
What brought us here?<br>
We tell the tale, Gub playacts along.<br>
As we talk about the Missing Moment, and that all the Aiudara activated.<br>
They mention Castovel's gates didn't open<br>
The gate we came through hasn't been active in 4000 years<br>
A-Lay-Lay noticed a Galorian gate activate for just a second, a week ago, a few hundred miles north of Seven Arches<br>
The Shadewither Key is an Aiudaran Access Key<br>
A-Lay-Lay touches the key and gets cursed!<br>
Gentheel reads the Key, and Remembers: the curse is Fey, but also has a psychic trigger controlling the curse and preventing it from being released, and it's a memory in this guy's memorybank.<br>
When he tries to remember it only says "O-SOY-O" and ancient dialect of Sovereign that means "whale"<br>
The voice is Gentheel's mother, a previous Rememberance of the town. Why would she censor it?<br>
Go find Gentheel's mother in <a data-href="The Garden" href="\The Garden" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Garden</a>!<br>
The mountian range has hosted many civilizations.<br>
Beneath <a data-href="Loskialua" href="\locations\loskialua.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Loskialua</a> is The Garden where the greatest minds go to be laid to rest, preserved by The Gardeners<br>
Few ppl return from The Gardeners, no one has had to ask in forever<br>
Ask to speak with Askar-eal<br>
We're lead out of the city and to the entrance to a cave.<br>
30 feet down a passage, then a very steep set of stairs down for like 45 minutes like a mile into the mountain<br>A cave carved /w leaveless treetrunks that looks like the Library Tree from Seven Arches<br>Into a cavern hundreds of feet high, walls covered in plant life. Ambushed by weird mole creatures!<br>

Dao inits great, devises a good strategm, and recalls that these are Immoles, and Dao shoots it<br>
Nishara recalls knowledge, it's not weak to anything in particular and has limited uses of it's biggest weapon, and Air Blasts<br>
A mole tries to fire blast all of us and fails<br>
The second mole roasts Gub, misses, and fails to roast Dao<br>
Pandora needle darts a mole for some damage,<br>
Gub rages, sees a procession of spirits, whiffs with the harpoon, and reels it back in<br>
Nishara Air Conditions the party and Conceals us all from their heat vision!<br>
Dao crit fails and is set aflame!<br>
The other one doesn't do much<br>
Pandora anthems and darts<br>
Gub hits a little /w the harpoon<br>
Dao battle medicines and runs to the water to put themselves out, plunging into deep waters<br>
One mole leaves, the other fails to microwave anyone<br>
Pandora anthems and darts<br>
Gub climbs the plants and Trips the mole off the wall to the ground, prone!<br>
Dao swims out and SUPERCRITS the mole to death.<br>A room of statues of a variety of creatures, all with similar robes.]]></description><link>session-notes\session-12-(2023-12-14).html</link><guid isPermaLink="false">Session Notes/Session 12 (2023-12-14).md</guid><pubDate>Sun, 03 Mar 2024 13:46:18 GMT</pubDate><enclosure url="lib\media\pasted-image-20240206085927.png" length="0" type="image/png"/><content:encoded>&lt;figure&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;lib\media\pasted-image-20240206085927.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Session 13 (2023-12-21)]]></title><description><![CDATA[<a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> <a class="tag" href="?query=tag:COMBAT" style="background-color: rgb(4, 108, 116); color: white; font-weight: 700; border: none; border-radius: 1em; padding: 0.2em 0.5em;">#COMBAT</a> 
 <br><br>We confront animated statues in a room of bas-relief figures, battling their psychic attacks with a mix of magic, thievery, and brute force.

Gub trips a Kappa making it take a check against<br>
Spiritsight sees mb a glimmer near the oasis<br>
Nishara kills the blue one, then Dao<br>
Some other Kappa show up as the actual guardians<br>

Trees /w leaves of all seasons and time, the spring phase changing<br>
Approaching the spring, silence and an eerie calm, light bubbling in the water.<br>
Dao says a prayer and collects some water. We leave and get a lil XP for not stealing more water than we needed. Descending the tower with a glowing waterskin, giving it to <a data-href="Jilial" href="\npcs\jilial.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Jilial</a> to run it back quicker, we follow up half a day later. The curative is almost done; in the communal space singing prayers to Dezna, and they bring out a glowing red potion<br>
<a data-href="A-Lay-Lay" href="\npcs\a-lay-lay.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">A-Lay-Lay</a> returns! As soon as the potion touches her lips, the <a data-href="Obnubilate Curse" href="\obnubilate-curse.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Obnubilate Curse</a> disappears, the first ever!<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240215101559.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240215101559.png"><br>
<a data-href="Oloffia" href="\npcs\oloffia.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Oloffia</a> spends the last drop of red potion on the key, and the curse coalesses into a drop that hits Nishara, who sees:<br>
Portal hub, a wall lined in labeled portals to various planes and locations, the find of a lifetime, knowledge to be cataloged! Stepping through, nothing. Blackness, a foot of ice cold water locking in place, an indistinct light. Now, a tree, the Memory Tree? a face with red eyes splits open revealing a book. The book evaporates to grotesque blackened hooked chains, torturous, wrapping into Nishara's arm. She's soothed by her compatriots (bleeding black fluid, their faces decaying with slight blue crystal).  A tiny voice "Nishara, resist!"<br>
A wraithlike pulse spreads from Nishara and gets zapped by her gatewalker tat.<br>

 <br><br>The party engages in a series of rapid transitions and combats across various planes. Starting with a dragon attack as they attempt to use the "Dragon's Gate," they find themselves battling in Mars' canyon (<a data-href="Akatun" href="\akatun.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Akatun</a>) against a ratman on a scorpion.

The scene transitions yet again to a desolate moon (<a data-href="Chi-ox" href="\chi-ox.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Chi-ox</a>), where we face a Cairn Wight.

The party navigates a computer labeled "Castrovel," linking to their past locations and warning against looking at certain planets. The city, fluctuating between destruction and normalcy, presents a shifting reality, challenged further by an encounter with a magical cat. Rescued by the Smiling Wolves, led by <a data-href="Innumma" href="\npcs\innumma.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Innumma</a> and <a data-href="Matz Balandim" href="\npcs\matz-balandim.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Matz Balandim</a>, they're guided through the twisted city using an Astrolabe and offered missions to aid in securing <a data-href="Skywatch" href="\locations\skywatch.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Skywatch</a>.<br>

<br>One elder per tribe, gathered and saw brighter auroras than normal, the sky was burning
<br>Elders came out weeks later, Aakuachi sent to Skywatch searching for the Falling Star

- Akatun, red planet, much closer, has trenches?<br>
Saku can show us around and try to find rations?<br>

It's night, bright stars.  It's cold, but, Gub and Nishara can make it ok.<br>
It's tough to predict the sequence. Everything's either burnt or ok.<br>
There's no carts, no ppl. We go looking for Sakuachi companions.<br>
As we move around the city, we seem to teleport.<br>
We meet a cat, and it leaves behind the building. It appears with a Leap and a Bound!<br>

<br>Saku gives Gub energy resistance and runs out of the cloud. 
<br>Nishara runs and readies a blast on the cat
<br>Dao runs out of the cloud. 
<br>Gub rages, can't find the cat, moves and Battle Medicines Dao
<br>The cat reappears behind Pandora and gets blasted. Cat crits and drops Pandora, then moves to Nishara and crits again
<br>Saku casts Guidance on all of us
<br>Nishara shields and misses twice
<br>Dao runs up and Treats Wounds on Pandora
<br>Gub runs and whiffs, but then hits finally, it's weak to Void damage
<br>Pandora stands up and Needle Darts, missing
<br>the Cat downs Nishara /w a crit, moves and bites into Gub with another crit

<br>They're able to move through the city /w an Astrolabe able to navigate the city, sometimes going through buildings
<br>Nishara tries to figure out Astronomy nerd stuff
<br>Some kinda strong magic twists the place. Follow the stars! relative to your position. 
<br>Astronomy, or Survival (now that we're aware) to navigate the city
<br>Takes about three hours to get across the city<br>
We get to the merc camp at the docks<br>

She welcomes us to the Market, for a fee (10gp per head!)<br>

Dao tries to search and <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a>  succeeds, finding Fae writing! Shopkeeper was a gnome, put himself into debt to craft an Arcane Guardian; the password is "bobble", and this chest doesn't beat Dao to death!<br>

The <a data-href="Dagron" href="\dagron.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Dagron</a> glows and breathes in blue glowy, venting it through his body, growing in size. It's eyes flash and an aoe hits us all (ref save), a wave of force 5ft burst<br>

<br>We've mastered Travel in Skywatch, and reach the <a data-href="Observatory" href="\Observatory" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Observatory</a>!<br>Heading back into the excavated hallway and the <a data-href="Aiudara" href="\aiudara.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aiudara</a> room, with the crowd of bodies facing us, the Gate flickering.<br>
Getting near the gate, Nishara's Astrolabe of the <a data-href="Falling Star" href="\falling-star.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Falling Star</a>s.<br>
A pyramid with stones in the distance, two worn changes, a Black Sun hangs heavy in a ring of fire. Before the pyramid, humanoid bodies appearing to bow. The pyramid flashes like water revealing a huge eye. "<a data-href="Osoyo" href="\osoyo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Osoyo</a>" echoes in our mind as <a data-href="Sakuachi" href="\npcs\sakuachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sakuachi</a>'s light pushes it all back! An <a data-href="Aqakaru" href="\aqakaru.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Aqakaru</a> in gold, a droplet of sun falls to the Pyramid, (Nishara sees the scene from the portal changes as if a silvery hand pulls the Sun to Galeron.) We've heard tales of this place, the <a data-href="Worldwound Scar" href="\locations\worldwound-scar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Worldwound Scar</a> in <a data-href="Sarkoris" href="\locations\sarkoris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sarkoris</a> (suffering under Demons), where the abyss took thousands of lives at the death of the demon god Deskari. Metal screeching and a snapping chain; a dark voice shouts "We are Osoyo, we will be free"<br><br>
The aiudara stabilizes before you. In the shimmering blue of the portal light, you see a great pyramid of pitch-black stone far in the distance, upon which two large silver chains, each looking weak and worn, bind the exterior. Above the <a data-href="pyramid" href="\pyramid" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">pyramid</a>, a black sun hangs heavy in the sky, a ring of fire flickering from its edges like tentacles. The field before the pyramid is host to an uncountable number of humanoid bodies, each kneeling in the snow before the dark structure, appearing to bow to its majesty. The structure’s surface ripples like water, and a great chasm breaks upon it, revealing a massive ice-blue eye shot through with luminous purple veins. The kneeling figures stand, a black mist sloughing off their bodies. "<a data-href="Osoyo" href="\osoyo.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Osoyo</a>" echoes through your minds, and somewhere deep inside, you hear your own voice repeat the call. <a data-href="Sakuachi" href="\npcs\sakuachi.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sakuachi</a> shines with a golden light in your sight, and it takes an immense amount of control to stop yourself from reaching for her, to stop yourself from snuffing out the hated light. A faint flicker on the surface of the Black Sun shows the Aqakaru, and a golden droplet of fire drips down from it. As it falls, it starts to flare out like a golden star, the light overtaking the pyramid. The scene through the portal changes, and Nishara, it almost seems like there’s a slim ivory hand in the star’s glare, guiding it across the sky of a now familiar landscape.
You’re heard tales of this place – seen the illustrations in journals and books. Perhaps you even have been there at some point, although doubtful, as you are all still alive. The falling star burns over the <a data-href="Worldwound Scar" href="\locations\worldwound-scar.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Worldwound Scar</a>, in the demon-haunted wasteland of <a data-href="Sarkoris" href="\locations\sarkoris.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Sarkoris</a>. Where the Abyss took countless lives, and a decade ago, a group of adventurers, commanders of the Last Crusade, slew the <a data-href="Demon Lord Deskari" href="\Demon Lord Deskari" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Demon Lord Deskari</a> to stop the endless invasion at the cost of their souls. The sound of metal screaming overtakes your mind. A chain snaps on the black pyramid. The portal light dies off, and the dark voice in your soul screams out in the pain of loss. OSOYO it cries. WE ARE OSOYO. WE WILL BE FREE.
<br>^ The Vision of the Skywatch Aiudara<br>How do we get to the Worldwound Scar?<br>
It's across the Bravoy Lake<br>
Sakuachi doesn't believe in coincidence, she seems to be filled with glorious purpose!<br>

The wheel's out of place, it's real nice. Great artisanship!<br>

"A visitor?" "It's tiny!" "Yes, for the master!"<br><br>
<br>Pandora anthems and moves

<br>Dao Tumbles Through the enemies, Devises, and Thinks!

<br>They're <a data-href="Wights" href="\session-notes\wights.html" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">Wights</a>! Drain health, not immune to precision!
<br>a glowing red mist comes out

10. Gub super <a href=".?query=tag:crits" class="tag" target="_blank" rel="noopener">#crits</a> the Wight and a mist claws at gubs eyes! Gub moves up and supercrits the Wight next to Dao<br>

<img alt="Pasted image 20240314221727.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240314221727.png"><br>

Deniigi has figured out the bilastea.<br>
Sakuachi sits and meditates. Innumma checks out the barrles, Ulikuq sleeps on the boxes. We have the ritual and the materials (50gp of pearls)! It takes an hour to cast!<br>
Rituals: <br>
<br>A primary caster, a secondary caster
<br>It's a downtime activity, or an exploration if it's less than 8h
<br>we have the Ghost Ship ritual
<br>Sailing Lore or Survival
<br>We gather upon the deck around the Captain! his incorporeal form flows into the ship!<br>

Gub succeeds! Pandora fails. Dao rolls well and succeeds! <br>Deniigi shouts that somethings coming, but Dao fists the ethereal Captain and finishes the ritual! The ship and all of us ghost-ify, the ship lifts above the ice, and we're off! The ship, unfettered, flies past the Jundland Wrecks. We've escaped!<br>"Finally, after hundreds of years, Pirate Captain Abney Tinhill sails again! The Mermaid's Tears sails again!"<br>
We're headed to Giggidy, four or five days at most, at which the Captain will pass on! Capstan Swabby brings out ale!<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240314225047.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240314225047.png"><br>It's open sailing, two days of limited <a data-href="downtime" href="\downtime" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">downtime</a>, a light rain.

Sarkorus: a land of many different things. A religious land, many gods and goddesses, beautiful land. Worldwould from Eruden's death, left a woulnd on reality. The Cult of Deskaren opened it even more. The city of Iz was torn open. We're headed to Mendev, the country nextdoor that got deviled-up when the Worldwould. Some Sarkorians survived, but the country was ruined. <br><br>In the morning, a sweet-smelling breeze brings a great thunderhead. Bad news and worse news!<br>
A black sailed ship with a Chillaxian flag! and a Thunderstorm. 20 mins to prepare before being boarded, we hear screams of jabbering!<br>

A Chillaxian vessel, <a data-href="The Red Dutchess" href="\The Red Dutchess" class="internal-link" target="_self" rel="noopener">The Red Dutchess</a> approaches!  A bolt of lightning explodes our Mast!  A smell of Vanilla and Sweat as from a corpse, and reality peels away; it's no illusion, it's memory<br>
The sun is low, crisp fall air, glowing gateway, the evening of the Missing Moment! But in this version, we're not alone. Our party members are there too, gazing at the gate, Sakuachi watches our group as a phantasm. We nod and walk through, as we did months ago.<br>
Will save as the memories assault us! Nishara fails :( The memory fades<br>Most of them in a drooling trance, only five are about!<br>

<br>Nishara goes off, and Air Slices into her! to death<br>
She becomes cognizant of what's going on, and pulls the disgusting eyeball out of her head, veins and all, and throws it overboard. she asks to be burned, shrikes gratefully as she morphs out of shape like a Resident Evil<br>
She says We'll Remember!
<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240321222530.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321222530.png"><br>The Erutaki and Captain come out and we return to time<br>
Sakuachi saw also our visions, but the Horned One was now being puppeted by something large in the distance.<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240321223525.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321223525.png"><br>A thundersnow storm! It worsens and worsens as we have to go below deck, which is now covered in ice! Once again vanilla and corpse sweat. The Storm wants us to remember something!<br>An endless barren o fsnow, and our compatriots, we're in a snow storm in an arctic wasteland, a force still obscured from our minds, we want it, we have to do it, our hands burn but we pull a sled and under a tarp, a massive humanoid figure clawed by chains, a palm mb of mountain apes drags with an akakaru, ahead a black pyramid, and in the distance Sakuachi, but then<br>back to the ship, and entitity forms on the deck! A humanoid of massive porportions! It wears our faces, <br><img alt="Pasted image 20240321224007.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321224007.png"><br>
the storm is furious!<br>
Moving at all requires an Acrobatics check!<br>
All flames get extinguished!<br><br>
<br>Dao misses a stratagem but know this is a "Manifested Blizzard" from metals or psychic emanation, and Phase Bolts a miss
<br>Pandora Anthems for 3 rounds and Needle Darts a miss /w the minus 2 boooo
<br>Nishara Extracts Element on it! successfully, extracting wooder, strides easily and Flames it! 

<br>We see ourselves even more covered in black goo!


<br>Creature Moves up, misses Gub, and misses Pandora
<br>Gub trips, rages, and takes a big chunk and gets blinded in a backlash spray of ice!
<br>Nishara melts most of it away! 
<br>It crits gub and eats a bunch of damage, then the persistent fire damage kills it!
<br>Through the storm Sakuachi comes up and doesn't notice the body dissolve out of the ice creature<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240321230721.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321230721.png"><br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240321230608.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321230608.png"><br>Captain Tinhill: Come down below deck for the rest of the storm. The Erutaki teach us some card games, and smirk to each other. Sakuachi looks deep in thought: she saw our visions with the horned one backed by some huge shape.<br>As we try to sleep, vanilla and corpse sweat, anohter memory: an instant move into this vision from dreams, trapped in these memories; a circle of black monoliths hundreds of feet tall, moonless, aurural lite, the sled from before is nowhere in sight! Sakujachi hest to the horned figure. Hundreds of figures spasm, yoy feel called through the  lue icy depths below, you see your self like in the snow blizzard, held in place by slender boney spkder lehs. you plead for help, you need to be free of her<br>Sakuachi's scream wakes us, her mouth agape, she stares at a mass of dark clouds, shimmering and resolving into<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240321231815.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321231815.png"><br>Sakuachi says: Your punishment, made manifest!<br>
The cloud bolts zooom to the ship  an icy wind covers the ship in jagged ice<br>
<img alt="Pasted image 20240321231927.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321231927.png"><br>these things wearing our faces and speaking our voices! They're made of stars? When they move it's like a brush of reality moving<br><img alt="Pasted image 20240321232342.png" src="\lib\media\pasted-image-20240321232342.png"><br>Doc says:<br>
An evening of celebrations, a sweeping pirate set-piece, a psychic blizzard that got absolutely wrecked, and story exposition that Dao will remember as "that was odd" - 6 months is wild!
But so many questions!
Are those memories really yours?
You'd never met before Ritalson united you all - how did you walk into a gate together on the night of the Missing Moment?
Who is the "Her," the one your ice-imprisoned form claims you have to get away / escape from? 
What's the significance of bony white arms &amp; fingers and a massive ape-thing with a symbol on its palm (exactly the same as Sakuachi)? Hmmm, have you ever seen an ape-like hand before, I wonder?
If the ship captain ripped out the wriggling black mass, why did she still start mutating?
Why the Horned One keep being so horn-y?
